    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        Pizza is a dish of Italian origin consisting of a usually round, flat base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and often various other ingredients, which is then baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 ¼ teaspoons active dry yeast</li><br>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons white sugar</li><br>
        <li>1 ⅛ cups warm water - 110 to 115 degrees F (43 to 45 degrees C)</li><br>
        <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li><br>
        <li>½ cup corn oil</li><br>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons kosher salt</li><br>
        <li>butter as needed, for greasing</li><br>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Dissolve yeast and sugar in warm water in a bowl. Let stand until yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam, 5 to 10 minutes.</li><br>
        <li>Combine yeast mixture, flour, corn oil, and kosher salt in a large stand mixer fitted with the dough hook; knead until dough holds together but is still slightly sticky, about 2 minutes.</li><br>
        <li>Form dough into a ball and transfer to a buttered bowl. Turn to coat dough with butter, then cover the bowl with a towel and let rise in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 6 hours.</li><br>
        <li>Punch down dough and let rest for 10 to 15 minutes. Press dough into a 10-inch deep-dish pizza pan and follow your pizza recipe.</li><br>
        <li>Add cheese, toppings, and tomatoes that you've flavored with garlic, basil, oregano, etc. Bake the pizza in an oven preheated to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C) for about 30 minutes, depending on your oven. You can prebake the crust for 10-15 minutes before adding toppings if desired.</li><br>
    </ol>
