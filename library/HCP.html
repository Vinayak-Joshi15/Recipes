    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        Crispy Honey Chilli Potatoes are a super addictive snack - fried chilli potato fingers are tossed in a sesame honey chilli sauce that's sweet and spicy and will give you sticky fingers that you'll be licking clean!
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Potatoes: Use old potatoes. Should be cut into â…“ inch thickness, approx 2-3 inches long. Ideally cut them all the same size so they cook at the same time
        </li><br>
        <li>Chilli Paste: Basically ground chillies made by soaking dried red chillies in hot water for 10-15 minutes and grinding to a paste
        </li><br>
        <li>Chilli Powder: Ground red chilli powder, different from 'chili powder' that you get in the U.S. which is a seasoning mix
        </li><br>
        <li>Garlic: Finely chopped - lots of it because flavour bomb!
        </li><br>
        <li>Honey: Plain honey, flavoured will not work well here
        </li><br>
        <li>Ketchup: It has the perfect balance and umami
        </li><br>
        <li>Soy sauce: Light soy sauce to add saltiness and rich flavour
        </li><br>
        <li>Sesame Seeds: They add flavour and crunch and stick to the potatoes because of the sauce
        </li><br>
        <li>Cornflour: Thickening agent, can be substituted with potato starch or tapioca starch
        </li><br>
        <li>Vinegar: To add some acidity and balance
        </li><br>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix together all the ingredients for the dry batter - chilli powder, chilli paste, garlic paste, all purpose flour, cornflour and salt. This will become a scraggly crumb like mixture
        </li><br>
        <li>Add potatoes and coat them well in the dry batter
        </li><br>
        <li>Deep fry the potatoes in batches. Drop them one potato at a time so they don't stick together
        </li><br>
        <li>Deep fry on a medium high flame for a few minutes till the potatoes are almost cooked and golden brown. Remove and set aside
        </li><br>
        <li>Make a thick batter by mixing together all purpose flour, corn flour, pepper and water</li><br>
        <li>Dip each half fried potato stick in it</li><br>
        <li>Fry the batter coated potatoes on high heat. Make sure to add potatoes one at a time so they don't stick to each other too much. Fry the potatoes in batch so you don't overcrowd the pan</li><br>
        <li>Fry till they are a nice golden brown. Remove on a tissue lined plate and set aside</li><br>
        <li>As soon as the potatoes are fried, heat oil in a large wok and add garlic. Saute the garlic for 30 seconds. Don't let it brown</li><br>
        <li>Add sesame seeds and saute for another 30 seconds or so, being careful not to brown them or they can taste burnt</li><br>
        <li>Add soy sauce, honey, ketchup, chilli paste, chilli flakes, vinegar and water and mix well</li><br>
        <li>Add the potatoes and toss them well so that the sauce covers the potatoes</li><br>
        <li>Add cornflour slurry and toss again for a minute or two till the cornflour cooks through</li><br>
        <li>The Honey Chilli Potatoes are ready to go!</li><br>
    </ol>
